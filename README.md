# N-Hub 

## Disclaimer

We are sorry for the incovience but this morning we discovered that on the creation of the project the network was bloated and it wasn't feasible to start fast a new project for the dependencies of nextjs, so we started from a repo with already downloaded node_modules not noticing it was made before the start of the hackathon. We are really sorry for this inconvenience but you can see that from the second commit the project was cleared of previous dependencies. We prefer to not clear the history to be fully transparent and share with you are WorkInProgress instead of creating a new one in the last hour.


## Getting Started
First, install the packages:
```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Smart contracts
The /contracts directory contains the smart contract that we have developed to implement our project.
It's also avaible as GitHub Gist like Remix IDE project https://gist.github.com/Feka7/d60e96e46dbee21e06244b4f2ea57bb8
Basically we cloned the EAS repository with Remix and deployed the new contracts here
